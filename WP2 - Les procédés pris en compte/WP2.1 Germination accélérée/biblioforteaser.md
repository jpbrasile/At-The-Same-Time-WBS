Briefing Document: Cold Plasma for Enhanced Seed Germination and Plant Growth
Date: October 26, 2023 Prepared For: [Intended Audience] Prepared By: AI Language Model Subject: Review of Research on Cold Plasma Applications in Seed Germination and Plant Growth

Executive Summary:

This briefing document summarizes the key themes and findings from a collection of research articles focused on the application of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) for enhancing seed germination and plant growth. The reviewed sources consistently demonstrate the potential of various cold plasma treatments (using different gases, pressures, and discharge methods) to positively influence seed surface properties, germination rates, seedling vigor, growth parameters, and even stress resistance in a range of plant species. The research highlights the complex interplay between plasma parameters, seed characteristics, and observed biological effects, suggesting that optimized plasma treatments could contribute to more sustainable agricultural practices by reducing the reliance on chemical phytosanitary products. However, the precise mechanisms of action and the optimal plasma configurations for different plant species and desired outcomes require further investigation.

Main Themes and Important Ideas/Facts:

1. Enhancement of Germination and Seedling Growth:

Multiple studies across various plant species (radish, wheat, tomato, basil, Arabidopsis, pine, soybean, etc.) show that cold plasma treatment can significantly improve seed germination rates and accelerate the germination process.
For instance, radish seeds exposed to Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) for 20 minutes showed increased root length (10%) and weight (30%) at early seedling stages. ["Radish seeds exposed during 20 minutes to a DBD (15 kV, 50 Hz) exhibit biological effects at early stages of seedlings growth while roots lengths and roots weight increase by 10% and 30% respectively [21]."] (Pre-Print_Sustainability.pdf)
Tomato seeds treated with low-pressure magnetized plasma exhibited markedly increased peroxidase (POD) and hydrogenase activity in seedlings. ["In the case of tomato seeds treated with a low-pressure magnetized plasma, the POD activity in the seedling’s hypocotyls is markedly increased compared with control (860 u.mg–1.pro.min–1 vs 410 u.mg–1.pro.min–1 respectively), as well as the hydrogenase activity of the roots assessed through the amount of TTC reduction (2.3 mg.root–1.h–1 for control vs 5.9 mg.root–1.h–1 for plasma) [23]."] (Pre-Print_Sustainability.pdf)
Atmospheric pressure DBD treatment of tomato seeds significantly influenced growth parameters, with mean root length at day 6 increasing from 45 mm (control) to 66 mm (plasma). ["If such treatment does not improve that much the germination rate, it considerably influences growth parameters (e.g., mean root length at day 6 is 45 mm long for control vs 66 mm long for plasma) [24]."] (Pre-Print_Sustainability.pdf)
Soybean seeds treated with RF low-pressure plasma showed improved seed growth and seedling establishment. (d2ra00809b.pdf)
Wheat seeds treated with a plasma jet at atmospheric pressure using nitrogen gas showed improved seed germination. (d2ra00809b.pdf)
Various DBD treatments (at atmospheric pressure with air or other gases) have demonstrated improved seed germination in radish, mung bean, wheat, tomato, lettuce, mustard, Dianthus, sticky bean, Arabidopsis, and pine. (d2ra00809b.pdf)
2. Impact on Seed Surface Properties:

Cold plasma treatment modifies the seed coat, affecting wettability, water uptake, morphology, and surface chemistry.
The "germination_these_laplace.pdf" document specifically mentions investigations into seed permeability, surface lipids, and mucilage effects after plasma treatment.
Water contact angle measurements are used to assess seed wettability, and water uptake is evaluated by measuring seed mass changes before and after imbibition. (Pre-Print_Sustainability.pdf)
Lipid analysis using GCMS is employed to determine the nature of surface modifications on treated seeds. (germination_these_laplace.pdf)
Plasma treatment can affect the mucilage layer of seeds like Arabidopsis thaliana, potentially impacting germination. (germination_these_laplace.pdf)
3. Role of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species (RONS):

Cold plasma generates a variety of RONS (e.g., O, O3, OH, NO, N2*, N2+, He*, He2+) that are believed to play a crucial role in the observed biological effects.
Mass spectrometry and optical emission spectroscopy are used to identify plasma chemical species. (Pre-Print_Sustainability.pdf)
The pre-print document suggests that "N2*, N2+, OH and NO together promote seed vigor in a significant way," while "O3 clearly shows inhibitory effects on seeds vigor."
The "germination_these_laplace.pdf" discusses the quantification of RONS like nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in plasma-activated water (PAW).
4. Plasma-Activated Water (PAW):

Treating water with cold plasma creates PAW, which can be used for irrigation and has shown positive effects on plant growth.
The "germination_these_laplace.pdf" details experiments using helium plasma jets to activate tap water and subsequently irrigate Arabidopsis thaliana plants, observing increased leaf number, rosette diameter, leaf area, and flowering.
PAW contains various long-lived RONS, and its physicochemical properties (e.g., conductivity, pH) are altered.
The effectiveness of PAW seems to depend on the source water and the plasma treatment parameters. ["D’ailleurs seule l’eau du robinet a montré un effet significatif sur la croissance."] (germination_these_laplace.pdf)
5. Plasma Sources and Parameters:

A wide range of plasma sources and operating parameters are explored in the research, including:
Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) in various configurations (volume, surface, seed-packed, jet).
Radiofrequency (RF) plasma.
Plasma jets (using different gases like helium and nitrogen).
Corona discharge.
Operating pressures ranging from low pressure to atmospheric pressure.
Various gases including air, oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and helium, as single gases or mixtures.
Different voltage amplitudes, frequencies, and treatment durations.
The "germination_these_laplace.pdf" provides detailed descriptions of the FE-DBD (in ambient air), helium plasma jet (in ambient air), and multi-point corona discharge devices used in their study, along with the electrical power supply characteristics.
The "s12870-024-04730-4.pdf" focuses on an argon DBD and its electrical characteristics.
The optimal plasma parameters (gas type, pressure, power, treatment time) are crucial and appear to be species-specific, with longer treatments sometimes causing damage. ["The best results are obtained for relatively short plasma exposure, while – surprisingly – longer DAPP damage the seeds."] (Pre-Print_Sustainability.pdf)
6. Mechanisms of Action:

While the positive effects of cold plasma are evident, the precise biological and chemical mechanisms underlying these effects are still under investigation.
Hypotheses include changes in seed coat permeability facilitating water and oxygen uptake, activation of metabolic pathways, and enhanced stress tolerance through the modulation of antioxidant enzyme activities.
The "germination_these_laplace.pdf" mentions future research directions to further understand the biological mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels.
7. Towards Sustainable Agriculture (PlaGeC Project):

The "Profil_poste_PlaGeC_VPostDoc.pdf" explicitly frames cold plasma treatment as a novel agricultural approach with "zéro utilisation de produits pesticides."
The PlaGeC project aims to enhance germination rates and plant growth using cold plasma to reduce the reliance on chemical phytosanitary products, aligning with environmental sustainability goals. ["Le projet PlaGeC se positionne dans cette optique en proposant une nouvelle approche agricole avec zéro utilisation de produits pesticides grâce à un procédé physique se basant sur les plasmas froids."] (Profil_poste_PlaGeC_VPostDoc.pdf)
The project involves collaboration between plant biology and low-temperature plasma expertise.
8. Impact on Stress Tolerance:

Some studies indicate that cold plasma treatment can enhance plant resistance to abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought.
Arabidopsis thaliana seeds treated with plasma showed different germination responses under saline conditions depending on their genotype. (germination_these_laplace.pdf)
Wheat treated with DBD at atmospheric pressure showed improved drought resistance. (d2ra00809b.pdf)
9. Seed Vigor and Germination Metrics:

Germination is assessed using various indicators, including germination potential (G%ma), median germination time (τ50), and vigor (S). (Pre-Print_Sustainability.pdf)
Figure 1 in the "Pre-Print_Sustainability.pdf" illustrates different types of improvements in germination curves related to germination potential, homogeneity, and vigor.
The "srep05859.pdf" uses metrics like germination potential, germination rate, germination index, and vigor index to evaluate the effects of cold plasma on soybean seeds.
10. Importance of Seed Variety and Genotype:

The response to cold plasma treatment can vary significantly between different plant species and even different cultivars or genotypes within the same species.
The "s12870-024-04730-4.pdf" highlights the varying tolerances of different soybean cultivars to argon DBD plasma based on their genotypes. ["The rate of increase in conductivity is different between the classes approv-ing their varying tolerances to plasma irritation based on their various genotypes."] (s12870-024-04730-4.pdf)
The "germination_these_laplace.pdf" shows differential effects of plasma treatment on the germination of Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and mutant lines (gl2 and gpat5) under normal and saline conditions.
